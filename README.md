# Histone-ChIP-seq-analysis

This workflow requires previously filtered .fastq files from ChIP-seq experiments. Fragment length is optimized for histone marks but may be changed for other proteins.

## Installation

This workflow uses multiple programs installed in a conda environment named chipseq env (environment.yml). 


## Comments

The scripts do not include THREAD options as they were written for a SLURM-based cluster.
